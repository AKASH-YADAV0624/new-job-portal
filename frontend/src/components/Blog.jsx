                <p className="my-2 text-lg text-gray-500 my-2">The job market has undergone a significant transformation over the past few decades, evolving from traditional paper-based listings to sophisticated online platforms that serve a multitude of functions. In the early days, job seekers relied heavily on printed classifieds in newspapers and bulletin boards, leading to a fragmented and often time-consuming search process. This method had inherent limitations, including geographical constraints and a lack of real-time updates, which made it difficult for applicants to find suitable opportunities efficiently.</p>
                <p className="my-2 text-lg text-gray-500 my-2">The introduction of the internet in the late 1990s marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of job portals. The first online job boards emerged, allowing users to browse listings tailored to their specific skills and location. This transition significantly streamlined the job search process, making it more accessible to a larger pool of candidates. Over time, features such as email notifications and the ability to upload resumes transformed the experience, giving job seekers more control and immediacy in their application processes.</p>
